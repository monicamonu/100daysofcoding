1 [Write a program that takes three numbers and prints their sum. Every number is given on a separate line.](day1.md)
2 [Write a program that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle and prints the area. Every number is given on a separate line.](day2.md)
3 [Write a program that greets the user by printing the word "Hello", a comma, the name of the user and an exclamation mark after it. See the examples below.](day3.md)
4 [Write a program that reads an integer number and prints its previous and next numbers. See the example below.](day4.md)
5 [N students take K apples and distribute them among each other evenly. The remaining (the indivisible) part remains in the basket. How many apples will each single student get? How many apples will remain in the basket?
The program reads the numbers N and K. It should print the two answers for the questions above.](day5.md)
6 [Given the integer N - the number of seconds that is passed since midnight - how many full hours and full minutes are passed since midnight?](day6.md)
7 [Given two timestamps of the same day: a number of hours, minutes and seconds for both of the timestamps. The moment of the first timestamp happened before the moment of the second one. Calculate how many seconds passed between them.](day7.md)
8 [Distance between two points
Write a program to calculate the distance between two points.
To find the distance between two points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2), all that you need to do is use the coordinates of these ordered pairs and apply some common sense. Begin with the most simplest formula and then incrementally arrive at the correct formula as you solve the test cases.](day8.md)
9 [Given a three-digit number. Find the sum of its digits.](day9.md)
10 [Given an integer, print "odd" if it's odd and print "even" otherwise.](day10.md)
11 [Given the year number. You need to check if this year is a leap year. If it is, print LEAP, otherwise print COMMON.](day10_3J.md)
12 [Given three integers, print the least of them.](day10_3_8.md )
13 [Given a month - an integer from 1 to 12, print the number of days in it in the year 2017.](day10_3_9.md)
14 [Write a program that receives a number on the input.
If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Jugs".
Otherwise, it prints the number.](day10_3p.md)
15 [Write a program that receives a number on the input.
If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Jugs".
If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints "Mugs".
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
Otherwise, it prints the number.](day10_3q.md)
16 [JugsMugsPugs
Write a program that receives a number on the input.
If the number is a multiple of 3, it prints "Jugs".
If the number is a multiple of 5, it prints "Mugs".
If the number is a multiple of 7, it prints "Pugs".
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it prints "JugsMugs".
If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 7, it prints "JugsPugs".
If the number is a multiple of both 5 and 7, it prints "MugsPugs".
If the number is a multiple of both 3, 5 and 7, it prints "JugsMugsPugs".
Otherwise, it prints the number.](day10_3r.md)
17 [Digit in Number
Read two inputs.
The first input is a digit.
The second input is a number.
Is the digit present in the number? If yes, return True.
If no, return False.](day11.md)
